        <p>
            A problem solver with a strong logical mind, I’m confident I will be able to do any required jobs to a high standard even if I’m not very experienced with them.
            I am a quick learner able to work independently with good initiative and have an intense interest in computers which I have explored from both software and hardware angles over the years, building my PC from the ground up and currently exploring a number of programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am incredibly eager to start my career in an entry level position having taken a few years out for mental health reasons.

        <h3>
            Fairtrade Shop
        </h3>
        <p>
            I voluntarily ran the school shop on a number of occasions, selling Fairtrade produce during a period where the school was attempting to raise Fairtrade awareness. To do this I was entrusted with the responsibility of proper time management, being trusted to handle money, and being polite and respectful towards other students.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Helping with my father’s business (Paper Domain)
        </h3>
        <p>
            This was voluntary experience assisting in the running operations of my father’s business selling IT Tech (specialising in printers and cartridges). As part of this I helped package items to prepare them for sale and helped out at the stalls during computer fairs.
